# Creating a Lamp stack

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Together, they provide a proven set of software for delivering high-performance web applications. Each component contributes essential capabilities to the stack. LAMP has a classic layered architecture, with Linux at the lowest level. The next layer is Apache and MySQL, followed by PHP. Although PHP is nominally at the top or presentation layer, the PHP component sits inside Apache.

- ``` sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y ```

This command will update and upgrade apt package. This package contains all the commands of linux

- "sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils libexpat1 ssl-cert -y"

This command will install apache web server. Web servers are used to serve Web pages requested by client computers. Clients commonly request and view Web sites using Web browser software such as Firefox, Opera, Chromium, or Internet Explorer.

- "sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0 php7.0-common php7.0-curl php7.0-dev php7.0-gd php-pear php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-mysql -y"

This command will install php and the requirements for Lamp server. PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. PHP is easy and powerful language. It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!. It is deep to run any big plateform and easy also.

- "sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client -y"

This command is going to install mysql server client. MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database. Despite its powerful features, MySQL is simple to set up and easy to use.

we need to change the ownership to access the file
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

this below command is going to enable the  apache2 service and php . If you look at the a2enmod command itâ€™s rather simple. a2enmod = Apache2 Enabled ModThe a2enmod command actually moves the Apache module files from /etc/apache2/mods-available to /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. And if you look at phpenmod it is going to enable the php for encrypt the files.
- "sudo a2enmod rewrite"
- "sudo phpenmod mcrypt"

Restarting the apache2 server

-"sudo service apache2 restart"

after that the Lamp server is getting install in your system. 
- "echo -e "\n\nLAMP Installation Completed""
- "exit 0"
